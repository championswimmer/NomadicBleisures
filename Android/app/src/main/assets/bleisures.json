    "description": "Oppressively hot.  Actually hard to find Balinesian food. There is a lot of overpriced, average, western, hipster food.  People are incredibly kind and the Balinesian food is great when you can find it.  The roads are ridiculously crowded while a lot of the restaurants, bars, and clubs were less than 30% full.  Kind of sad for local business owners.  Surrounding area is beautiful and relatively accessible.  Aside from western food & beverage lodging, food and beverage can be very cost effective.  Other parts of the island are better for experiencing the Balinesian life, but it is more of a challenge to mix socially with local  people here than other places as most people work in service industries or agriculture.  It is what it is.  In the end, if you like oppressive heat & humidity, western millennial cuisine, crowded roads, and a small beach, this may be your place.",

Which is interesting if you're in Asia a lot and you want medical care better than you can get in your home country.\n\nBumrungrad Hospital in Bangkok is ranked #7 in the world. I did an executive health checkup there and it was great. Prices range from $250 to $750 depending on how many checks you want. You can get blood count, X Ray, ultrasound, hormone check, etc.\n\nThey also have most other medical disciplines. I also got vaccinations renewed. The hospital is private so it's so much better than the overloaded public healthcare systems of Europe, Canada and UK where everyone tries to avoid helping you, is overworked and angry. In Bangkok they're super nice and helpful and you can make appointments straight with a specialist. Not blocked by a GP like in your home country.\n\n",

It is also quite diverse in terms of LGBTTQQIAAP and there's plenty of offer to be entertained. \nI see that hospitals are badly ranked in the Nomad ranking but I'd like to make a point here: public hospitals are free to use by anyone (no matter nationality nor residency status) and they are collapsed. Normally, people pay (the ones that can) around 100/110usd per month (the same way you pay in the majority of the countries) for a private health system which is excellent. So, that is not an issue at all. ",

    "description": "Spend a few hours and learn the Korean alphabet (not that hard) and Google some names of Korean dishes + it's spelling in Korean. It will help a lot as most restaurants only have Korean menu's and often without pictures.\n\nAs mentioned previously on the reviews, it's a little hard to eat alone, but Gimbab Chonguk (김밥천국) is everywhere and 24/7 - no one will bat an eye. Also look for places that \"specialises\" in dumplings, They are usually \"alone-eating\" friendly. And so are ramen places as well as Korean \"chinese\" restaurants -  Jajangmyeon (자장면) is very good and super addictive. Bibimbab restaurant places are fine too. Actually, it's not that hard to eat alone in Korea. The \"group\" meals are generally quite obvious and will be things like BBQ. You'll figure it out.\nDo Get used to kimchi and spicy food otherwise you'll end up eating the same thing all the time. Be adventurous. Challenge yourself and eat an octopus alive (산낙지). If you're really brave try 보신탕 before authorities close them all - I haven't but a lot of Weagukins (foreigners) secret do. \n\nCafe's generally have really good wifi, as you would expect from one of the most connected countries in the world. Expect to pay $4-6 for a latte and maybe even more at Starbucks.\nBest cafe's are usually around Hipster areas and Universities. Indie owned cafe's are awesome.\n\nNightlife is great, probably amongst the best in Asia. Can get very expensive especially at night clubs in Gangnam where it would could be like $10 for a beer - in that case you can still get drunk for $2 with soju just outside at 7Eleven.\n\nWinters are stupidly cold and summers can be brutally hot & humid. Go between April and June or September to October. They have cherry blossoms in spring which is beautiful and so are the autumn leaves.\n\nLived here for many years. It's a cool place and vastly underrated.\n\nSeoul is continuously becoming more expensive and cost of living will soon be comparable with places like Tokyo.",
